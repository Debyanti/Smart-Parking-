# Smart-Parking-
The main aim of this project is to present a mobile-based system that enables users to view and reserve a parking slot. With a rapid increase in the vehicle usage in the recent fast, Finding and reaching a free parking slot has become time consuming and tedious, especially in the metro cities. This system would be very handy for large parking systems where it is difficult to locate the allotted slot; the user can see the shortest route to the allotted slot on the mobile app itself and hence reach their easily. In order to ensure reliability, a timer is set as soon as the user books a slot based on the user's current location. The user is expected to reach the allotted slot before time runs out. The booked space will be marked yellow and will not be available for anyone else for the specified time. This system provides additional feature of cancelling the bookings. The system provides a graphical view of the parking. it saves user time in search of parking space available in such a long parking area.
